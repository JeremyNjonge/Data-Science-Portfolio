## Natural Language Processing

The field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers is called Natural Language Processing, 
or NLP for short. It sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics 

Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction 
between computers and humans using the natural language.
The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.
Most NLP techniques rely on machine learning to derive meaning from human languages.
